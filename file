Step 1: I am Choosing Azure as the Cloud Platform

Step 2: Creating Necessary Infrastructure
2.1 Networking Setup:

Create a Virtual Network (VNet):
Azure's Virtual Network provides isolation and segmentation. Create a VNet with subnets to separate the web, application, and database tiers.

Set Up Network Security Groups (NSG):
NSGs act as firewalls for Azure resources. Define NSGs for each tier, specifying inbound and outbound rules to control traffic.

Configure Route Tables:
Implement route tables to control traffic between subnets. Associate the web subnet with internet access, and application/database subnets without direct internet access.

2.2 Compute Setup:

Launch Web Server:
Deploy a virtual machine (VM) in the public subnet to host the web server. Assign a public IP for external accessibility.

Launch Application Server:
In the private subnet, launch VMs for the application tier. Install Node.js and configure the Aquila MERN application. Restrict traffic to and from the web and database tiers.

Launch Database Server:
Set up a database instance (e.g., MongoDB) in the private subnet. Define NSG rules to permit traffic exclusively from the application tier.

Step 3: Database Configuration

Configure Aquila Application:
Modify the Aquila application's configuration to use the private IP address of the database server. This ensures secure communication within the private network.

Step 4: CI/CD Setup

Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:
Utilize Azure DevOps or a CI/CD tool to automate the deployment process. Configure a pipeline to fetch, build, and deploy the Aquila application to the application tier.

Step 5: High-Level Design (HLD) Diagram

Create a diagram to visually represent the three-tier architecture, including VNet, subnets, VMs, and NSGs. Clearly illustrate the flow of traffic and separation of tiers.
Step 6: Web Application URL or IP Address

Share the public IP address assigned to the web server in the public subnet as the Aquila web application URL. This ensures external users cannot directly access the application.
Additional Considerations:

Azure RBAC:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure to manage permissions and access control effectively.

SSL/TLS:
Enforce SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit, enhancing the security of communication.

Update and Patching:
Regularly update and patch VMs, services, and components to address security vulnerabilities.

Monitoring:
Implement monitoring solutions to ensure the infrastructure's performance and security are continually assessed.
